Ninja Block v2 Mount
====================

I needed a mount to let me mount the Ninja Block v2 to a surface (in
my case a door.)

The mount had to also allow me to easily remove and re-add the Ninja
Block being held so I could hack on it.

Pretty simplistic and the OpenSCAD should be easy to edit if you need
to change things like the screw holes.
